# README: Airline Profitability Prediction Model

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict airline profitability based on historical flight performance and operational data. The model helps airline operators understand the key drivers of profitability, optimize operations, and make data-driven business decisions.

## Objective
The primary objective is to create a **high-performance ML model** that accurately predicts **Profit (USD)** for each flight while providing actionable insights to improve operational efficiency and profitability.

## Dataset Description
The dataset includes the following key features:
- Flight delays (Minutes)
- Aircraft utilization (Hours/Day)
- Turnaround time (Minutes)
- Load factor (%)
- Fleet availability (%)
- Maintenance downtime (Hours)
- Fuel efficiency (ASK)
- Revenue (USD)
- Operating costs (USD)
- Net profit margin (%)
- Ancillary revenue (USD)
- Debt-to-equity ratio
- Revenue per ASK
- Cost per ASK
- Profit (USD) (Target Variable)
## Deplolyed App
